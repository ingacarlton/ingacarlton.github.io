<h2> <p align="center"> "Man cannot discover new oceans unless he has the courage to lose sight of the shore."
- Andre Gide </p> </h2>


<h3> I was privileged to be able to travel to beautiful places growing up and I am incredibly thankful for the experience. 
Some of my favorite places I have been are Virgin Gorda, Puerto Rico, Spain, Azores, and Iceland.
I would love to keep traveling for the rest of my life and possibly live in other countries. </h3>




<h2> Virgin Gorda </h2>

<div class="picture">
	<img src="baths.JPG" align="left" width="300"> The Baths National Park in Virgin Gorda is full of granite boulders that form pools. The rocks
almost appear man made, because the way they are arranged is picturesque.

<h2 align="right">  Puerto Rico </h2>


<div class= "picture">
	<img src = "elyunque.JPG" width= "300" align="right">El Yunque National forest is a rainforest home to a special frog called a coqui.
	 Coqui's get their name from the noise they make at night. El Yunque is the only tropical rainforest in the United States forest system.

<h2> Spain </h2>
Any "Game of Thrones" fans? Girona is a small city located in Catalonia, about an hour north 
of Barcelona, where scenes from "Game of Thrones" were shot.

<h2 align="right"> Azores </h2>
<img src = "tea.JPG" width= "300" align="right"> The Azores are a group of Portuguese islands in the Atlantic Ocean. When I visited the Azores
I went to Sao Miguel, which is the largest of the islands. On Sao Miguel there is a tea plantation, 
and it is the only one in all of Europe.

<h2>Iceland </h2>

Iceland is one of the most extraterrestrial places I have ever been to. There are fields of lava
covered in green moss, and barely any trees. My favorite part of Iceland was its numerous waterfalls, 
that ranged from a few feet to hundreds of feet high.
