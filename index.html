<h2> <p align="center"> First Year Student at the University of Maine, Orono </p></h2>


Hello and welcome to my website! I am from South Berwick, ME and went to Marshwood High School. 
I enjoy travelling, hiking, surfing and playing tennis. I love animals, and I have a cat named Gigi.
I am a Business student at the University of Maine, and I am planning on minoring in Spanish.
I would love to study abroad in Spain during college and combine the language with business. 
During high school I played Volleyball, Indoor Track and Tennis. A fun fact is that the first year 
our Volleyball team became a varsity sport we made it to playoffs! I was privileged to be able to travel
to beautiful places growing up and I am incredibly thankful for the experience. Some of my favorite places
I have been are Tortola, Puerto Rico, Spain, Azores, and Iceland. I would love to keep traveling
for the rest of my life and possibly live in other countries.
